Thank you for your interest in Breville! To maximize our time with you, and to better simulate how we would be working together, we’d love for you to spend no more than 2 hours on the following project in your choice of IDE. Don’t worry if you don’t finish, but be prepared to screen share, and talk us thru your approach, and associated topics, during your first interview segment.


## Instructions

The task is to create a user interface component that allows the user to pick from a list of available WiFi networks.  Imagine you are building a screen that is part of the process a user follows to provision WiFi on an IoT device.

Please implement a function and UI component to render a list of available WiFi networks for a user to choose from. The skeleton project includes a mock data publisher (in src/service/wifi.js) that will provide regular updates to a list of scanned SSIDs and signal strengths. The mock data may include networks that appear/disappear, or it may sometimes return no data.


## Use whatever framework you want

This repro contains a template React JS app created with create-react-app, but you may use any web/mobile UI framework.  For example, React Native, Flutter, Angular, and others are all perfectly fine.  If you choose to use a different framework the only file you need from this repro is src/service/wifi.js.
